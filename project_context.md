# Project Context: BoardRoom Repo Initial Documentation

## Goal

The main goal is to formalize the project's documentation by adding an engineering review, updating the README, and creating an architecture skeleton. All work must be done on separate branches with corresponding pull requests.

## Key Information

- **Project Name:** BoardRoom
- **Core Tech:** FastAPI, LangGraph, Redis Streams, PostgreSQL, Tauri
- **Secrets Management:** `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
- **Upcoming Integrations:** Browserbase and Fetch MCP servers.
- **Workflow:** All changes must be submitted via pull requests from feature branches to `main`. No direct commits to `main`.

## Deliverables

1. An open PR for `ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md`.
2. An open PR for the updated `README.md` and new `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Verification that the application still runs after the changes.
4. Notes on any ambiguities or follow-up work included in the PR descriptions.
