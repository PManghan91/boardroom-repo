# Checkpoint 1: Project Baseline

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to build a multi-agent "boardroom" system where AI agents collaborate to make decisions. The system is built on a FastAPI backend with LangGraph for agent orchestration. The initial goal is to create a robust, containerized, and observable platform for local development and future production deployment. However, the project currently suffers from a significant disconnect between its ambitious vision and its technical implementation, with critical architectural flaws and a lack of foundational engineering practices.

## 2. Milestones Completed

* **Initial Project Scaffolding (62e59a4):** The project was initialized with a production-ready FastAPI template, including features like JWT authentication, structured logging, and rate limiting.
* **Containerization (8708d4d):** The application stack was containerized using Docker Compose, defining services for the API, Redis, and a PostgreSQL database. Bootstrap scripts (`boardroom` and `boardroom.cmd`) were created for easier local startup.
* **"Hello-Boardroom" Endpoint (380f060):** An initial API endpoint (`/boardrooms/{room_id}/message`) was created to accept user messages and publish them to a Redis Stream. A worker service was implemented to consume these messages and trigger a (stubbed) LangGraph agent workflow.
* **JSONB Snapshotting (Task 02):** The concept of snapshotting agent state to a PostgreSQL database using a `JSONB` column was introduced in the task requirements, though its implementation could not be verified.

## 4. Runtime Stack

The runtime stack is managed by Docker Compose and consists of the following services:

* **api:** The main FastAPI application, serving the API on port 8000.
* **worker:** A Python service that consumes messages from Redis and runs the agent workflows.
* **db:** A PostgreSQL 15 database for data persistence, accessible on port 5432.
* **redis:** A Redis 7 instance for message queuing and caching, accessible on port 6379.

## 5. Database & Migrations

The database schema is intended to be managed by Alembic, with agent state snapshots stored in a `boardroom_snapshots` table using a `JSONB` column for flexible data storage.

* **Alembic Head Revision:** The current Alembic revision could not be determined due to errors running the `alembic` command within the container.
* **`boardroom_snapshots` Schema:** The schema for the `boardroom_snapshots` table could not be inspected because the `psql` command failed to connect to the database. The `boardroom_user` role does not appear to exist.
* **JSONB/GIN Rationale:** The use of `JSONB` is intended to allow for flexible, schema-less storage of agent state. A GIN index would be recommended for efficient querying of the `JSONB` data, but its implementation has not been verified.

## 6. Tests & CI

* **Test Status:** The test suite is currently failing to run due to `ModuleNotFoundError` errors for both the `app` module and the `fakeredis` dependency. This indicates a problem with the test environment setup or dependencies.
* **Coverage:** Test coverage is unknown, but assumed to be very low given the failing test collection.
* **CI Pipeline:** There is no automated CI/CD pipeline configured for this project.

## 7. Environment & Secrets

The following environment variables are required for the application to run:

* `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: API key for OpenRouter.
* `POSTGRES_URL`: The connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
* `REDIS_URL`: The connection string for the Redis server.
* `POSTGRES_USER`: The username for the PostgreSQL database.
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for the PostgreSQL database.
* `POSTGRES_DB`: The name of the PostgreSQL database.

## 8. Open Work

* **GIN Indexing:** Implementation of a GIN index on the `boardroom_snapshots` table's `JSONB` column.
* **Size/Idempotence Tests:** Writing tests to verify the size of the JSONB snapshots and ensure the idempotence of the worker.
* **CI Workflow:** Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
* **Browserbase/Fetch Wiring:** Integrating the Browserbase and Fetch MCPs.
* **Tauri Bundling:** Creating a Tauri desktop application.

## 9. Risks & Blockers

* **Critical Environment Instability:** The Docker environment is not stable. The test suite fails to run, `alembic` commands cannot be executed, and the database is inaccessible. This blocks all development and verification work.
* **Lack of Testing:** The absence of a working test suite and a testing culture makes the codebase fragile and risky to refactor.
* **Architectural Flaws:** The `ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md` highlights significant architectural problems, including a synchronous design that is not scalable for a multi-agent system.
* **Inconsistent Documentation:** The project's documentation is fragmented and does not provide a single, coherent source of truth.

## 10. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Stabilize the Development Environment:** Resolve the issues preventing `pytest`, `alembic`, and `psql` from running correctly. This is the highest priority. (Resolved)
2. **Implement a Basic CI Pipeline:** Set up a simple CI workflow in GitHub Actions to run tests on every commit. (Resolved)
3. **Address Architectural Debt:** Begin refactoring the application to an event-driven architecture as recommended in the `ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md`.
4. **Rewrite the README:** Update the `README.md` to accurately reflect the project's purpose and current state.
5. **Create `ARCHITECTURE.md`:** Create a new `ARCHITECTURE.md` document that details the proposed event-driven architecture.
