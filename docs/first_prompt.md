### Current Status
- **All 16 tasks are pending** - no implementation work has begun
- Tasks are designed for sequential execution with defined dependencies
- Each task includes specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and solo execution approach

## Technical Context

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (>=0.115.12) with async/await patterns
- **AI Framework**: LangGraph (>=0.4.1) with LangChain integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM
- **Caching/Queuing**: Redis Streams (integration pending)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Langfuse
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Testing**: pytest framework (suite needs implementation)

### Key Dependencies (from [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml))
```toml
fastapi>=0.115.12
langgraph>=0.4.1
langchain>=0.3.25
sqlmodel>=0.0.24
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10
langfuse==3.0.3
prometheus-client>=0.19.0
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set environment
make set-env ENV=development
source scripts/set_env.sh development

# Run development server
make dev

# Access documentation
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Current Architecture State
- **Incomplete LangGraph Integration**: Core graph logic in [`app/core/langgraph/boardroom.py`](app/core/langgraph/boardroom.py) needs completion
- **Basic API Structure**: Endpoints defined but missing business logic implementation
- **Database Schema Mismatch**: [`schema.sql`](schema.sql) doesn't align with model definitions
- **Missing Authentication Security**: JWT implementation needs security hardening
- **No Test Coverage**: Test suite completely missing (priority task)

## Next Actions

### Pre-Execution: Environment Verification
**Before starting any tasks, verify the development environment:**

```bash
# 1. Verify dependencies are installed
uv sync
echo "✓ Dependencies installed"

# 2. Check environment configuration
make set-env ENV=development
source scripts/set_env.sh development
echo "✓ Environment configured"

# 3. Test basic application startup
make dev &
sleep 5
curl http://localhost:8000/health
kill %1
echo "✓ Application starts successfully"

# 4. Verify database connectivity
python -c "from app.services.database import database_service; print('✓ Database connection:', database_service.health_check())"

# 5. Check key environment variables
python -c "
import os
required_vars = ['POSTGRES_URL', 'LLM_API_KEY', 'JWT_SECRET_KEY']
missing = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]
if missing:
    print('✗ Missing environment variables:', missing)
    exit(1)
else:
    print('✓ All required environment variables present')
"
```

### Git Workflow for Task Execution

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
# For each task, create a feature branch
git checkout -b task-01-security-audit
git checkout -b task-02-database-schema
# etc.
```

**Commit Convention:**
```bash
# Use conventional commits aligned with task numbers
git commit -m "feat(task-01): implement automated security scanning"
git commit -m "fix(task-01): resolve critical authentication vulnerability"
git commit -m "docs(task-01): add security audit findings"
git commit -m "test(task-01): add security validation tests"

# Task completion commit
git commit -m "feat(task-01): complete security audit and vulnerability assessment

- Implemented automated security scanning with bandit/safety
- Identified and documented 3 critical vulnerabilities
- Established secure authentication patterns
- Added security practices documentation
- Integrated security checks into development workflow

Closes: Task 01
Next: Task 02 - Database Schema Alignment"
```

**Task Completion Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Complete task implementation on feature branch
# 2. Update task_list.md progress
# 3. Make final task completion commit
# 4. Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge task-01-security-audit
git tag task-01-complete
git push origin main --tags

# 5. Create next task branch
git checkout -b task-02-database-schema
```

### Immediate Priority: Start Task 01
1. **Verify Environment**: Run the environment verification checklist above
2. **Create Task Branch**: `git checkout -b task-01-security-audit`
3. **Begin with Task 01**: [`docs/tasks/task_01_security_audit.md`](docs/tasks/task_01_security_audit.md)
   - Security audit and vulnerability assessment
   - Foundation task that informs all subsequent security decisions
   - Estimated: 2-3 days, Week 1 (Days 1-3)

### Execution Approach
1. **Verify environment** using checklist above before starting
2. **Create feature branch** for the task
3. **Read the specific task document** for detailed requirements
4. **Follow git workflow** with conventional commits
5. **Update [`docs/task_list.md`](docs/task_list.md)** progress as you work
6. **Follow solo development principles** - practical over perfect
