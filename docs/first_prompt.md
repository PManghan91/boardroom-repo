# Claude Handoff Prompt: Boardroom AI Project Continuation

## Project Overview & Context

You are taking over development of **Boardroom AI**, a FastAPI + LangGraph agent template for AI-powered meeting assistance. This is a **solo founder project** with **Claude Code as the primary development partner**, focusing on lean MVP development rather than enterprise-scale architecture.

**Current Project State:**
- Documentation restructure has been completed (from multi-team to solo approach)
- All 16 remediation tasks have been defined and documented
- Git staging completed with organized docs/ structure
- Ready to begin sequential task execution
- **No code implementation has started yet** - all tasks are pending

**Development Philosophy:**
- Solo founder + Claude Code collaboration
- Lean development focused on MVP functionality
- Practical solutions over perfect architecture
- 10-week execution timeline with sequential task completion

## What Has Been Accomplished

### Current Status
- **All 16 tasks are pending** - no implementation work has begun
- Tasks are designed for sequential execution with defined dependencies
- Each task includes specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and solo execution approach

## Technical Context

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (>=0.115.12) with async/await patterns
- **AI Framework**: LangGraph (>=0.4.1) with LangChain integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM
- **Caching/Queuing**: Redis Streams (integration pending)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Langfuse
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Testing**: pytest framework (suite needs implementation)

### Key Dependencies (from [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml))
```toml
fastapi>=0.115.12
langgraph>=0.4.1
langchain>=0.3.25
sqlmodel>=0.0.24
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10
langfuse==3.0.3
prometheus-client>=0.19.0
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set environment
make set-env ENV=development
source scripts/set_env.sh development

# Run development server
make dev

# Access documentation
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Current Architecture State
- **Incomplete LangGraph Integration**: Core graph logic in [`app/core/langgraph/boardroom.py`](app/core/langgraph/boardroom.py) needs completion
- **Basic API Structure**: Endpoints defined but missing business logic implementation
- **Database Schema Mismatch**: [`schema.sql`](schema.sql) doesn't align with model definitions
- **Missing Authentication Security**: JWT implementation needs security hardening
- **No Test Coverage**: Test suite completely missing (priority task)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priority: Start Task 01
1. **Begin with Task 01**: [`docs/tasks/task_01_security_audit.md`](docs/tasks/task_01_security_audit.md)
   - Security audit and vulnerability assessment
   - Foundation task that informs all subsequent security decisions
   - Estimated: 2-3 days, Week 1 (Days 1-3)

### Execution Approach
1. **Read the specific task document** for detailed requirements
2. **Update [`docs/task_list.md`](docs/task_list.md)** progress as you work
3. **Follow solo development principles** - practical over perfect
4. **Make focused git commits** for each completed task
5. **Move sequentially** through tasks respecting dependencies

### Weekly Progress Pattern
- **Complete 1-2 tasks per week** depending on complexity
- **Update progress tracking** in [`docs/task_list.md`](docs/task_list.md)
- **Document key decisions** and lessons learned
- **Focus on MVP functionality** over enterprise features

## Reference Documents

### Primary References
- [`docs/DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md) - Complete technical reference (API endpoints, commands, troubleshooting)
- [`docs/task_list.md`](docs/task_list.md) - Master task list with progress tracking
- [`docs/PROJECT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md) - Technical debt analysis and context

### Task Specifications
All 16 tasks have individual specification documents in [`docs/tasks/`](docs/tasks/):
- Task structure: Description, deliverables, acceptance criteria, timeline, dependencies
- Solo execution approach with founder + Claude Code collaboration
- Specific technical requirements and success metrics

### Historical Context
- [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/) - Previous analysis and documentation for context
- [`README.md`](README.md) - Project overview and setup instructions
- Root configuration files: [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml), [`.env.example`](.env.example), [`Makefile`](Makefile)

## Development Constraints & Approach

### Solo Development Principles
- **Lean Implementation**: Focus on essential functionality over comprehensive features
- **MVP Priority**: Build core boardroom functionality that works, not enterprise-scale
- **Practical Solutions**: Choose implementation approaches that are maintainable by one person
- **Learning-Oriented**: Select technologies and patterns that build knowledge for future scaling

### Quality Standards (Realistic)
- **Test Coverage**: Target 70%+ for critical functionality (not 100%)
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in core functionality
- **Performance**: API response times <500ms (acceptable for MVP)
- **Documentation**: Essential documentation for maintenance and future scaling

### Execution Constraints
- **Sequential Task Execution**: Complete tasks in order respecting dependencies
- **Weekly Milestones**: Aim for 1-2 task completions per week
- **Solo Maintenance**: All solutions must be manageable by founder alone
- **Future Scaling**: Keep architecture decisions that support team growth

### Technology Choices
- **Proven Patterns**: Use established patterns over cutting-edge solutions
- **Community Support**: Prefer well-documented technologies with active communities
- **Operational Simplicity**: Choose deployment and monitoring approaches suitable for solo ops

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Milestones
- **Task 01-06 Completion**: Secure foundation with testing (Weeks 1-4)
- **Task 09 Success**: Core LangGraph integration working (Week 6-7)
- **Task 15 Achievement**: Deployable system with CI/CD (Week 9)
- **All Tasks Complete**: Production-ready MVP system (Week 10)

### Quality Gates
- **Security**: Pass automated security scans with zero critical issues
- **Testing**: Achieve 70%+ test coverage on core functionality  
- **Performance**: Meet <500ms response time targets
- **Deployment**: One-command deployment with monitoring

### Solo Development Success
- **Self-Sufficiency**: All systems manageable by founder alone
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation for future team members
- **Scaling Readiness**: Architecture supports team growth without major rewrites
- **MVP Viability**: Core boardroom functionality operational for user validation

## Your Mission

**You are now the primary development partner for this solo founder project. Your immediate task is to:**

1. **Review Task 01** in [`docs/tasks/task_01_security_audit.md`](docs/tasks/task_01_security_audit.md)
2. **Begin implementation** following the solo development approach
3. **Update progress** in [`docs/task_list.md`](docs/task_list.md) as you work
4. **Work sequentially** through all 16 tasks over the next 10 weeks
5. **Focus on MVP functionality** that enables user validation

**Remember**: This is lean development focused on getting a working MVP, not building enterprise software. Make practical choices that serve the solo founder's immediate needs while keeping future scaling possible.

**Success means**: A working, secure, deployable boardroom AI system that the founder can operate and maintain solo while validating with early users.

Start with Task 01 and let's build this together! 🚀
