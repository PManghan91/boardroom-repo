# Task 05: Standardized Error Handling and Logging (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Create essential error handling patterns and logging setup for effective troubleshooting and maintainable solo development workflow.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Basic exception classes in `app/core/exceptions.py`
- [ ] Consistent error response format for core endpoints
- [ ] Essential logging for troubleshooting
- [ ] Simple FastAPI error handling middleware
- [ ] Basic error categorization
- [ ] Simple error monitoring setup
- [ ] Error handling documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core errors return standardized JSON response format
- Error responses include appropriate HTTP status codes
- Essential errors logged for troubleshooting
- Error handling middleware catches common exceptions
- Error messages are clear without exposing sensitive data
- Basic error monitoring functional

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Timeline**: Week 1-2 (Days 3-4)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential error patterns

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 01 (security audit findings)
- **Blocks**: None (enhances all other tasks)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 06 (testing setup)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use Python's logging module with basic structure
- Implement essential log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Ensure error responses don't leak sensitive information
- Basic integration with existing monitoring
- Keep error handling patterns simple and clear

## Success Metrics
- Core errors have consistent response format
- Essential errors properly logged
- Error handling doesn't impact performance
- Zero sensitive information in error messages
- Basic error monitoring functional

## Notes
Foundation for effective troubleshooting during solo development. Focus on practical error handling that aids debugging without over-engineering.
