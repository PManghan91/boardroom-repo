# Task 13: Essential Service Integration and Health Checks (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement essential service health checks and basic service communication patterns for solo maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Essential service health checks for core dependencies
- [ ] Basic service communication patterns
- [ ] Simple error propagation across service boundaries
- [ ] Basic service dependency documentation
- [ ] Integration testing for core service interactions
- [ ] Simple service monitoring setup
- [ ] Basic service documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Health checks validate core service dependencies (database, Redis)
- Basic service communication patterns established
- Errors propagate with essential context
- Core service dependencies documented
- Integration tests cover essential service interactions
- Basic service monitoring functional

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 8 (Days 1-3)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential health checks and service patterns

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 07 (monitoring), Task 08 (API standards)
- **Blocks**: Task 15 (deployment requires service health)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 10 (Redis integration)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Implement health checks for database, Redis, essential external APIs
- Use basic error handling patterns across services
- Simple graceful degradation for service unavailability
- Basic service contract documentation
- Integration with basic monitoring setup

## Success Metrics
- Health checks detect core service issues
- Service communication errors handled appropriately
- Integration tests cover essential service interactions
- Service dependency issues identifiable
- Basic service availability monitoring functional

## Notes
Focus on essential service health and communication patterns that support solo development and maintenance. Establish foundations for future scaling.
