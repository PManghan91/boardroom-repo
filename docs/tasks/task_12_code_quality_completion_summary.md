### Modern Python 3.13 Syntax Implementation

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import AsyncGenerator, Dict, Any, Optional

async def lifespan(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncGenerator[None, None]:
    """Handle application startup and shutdown events."""
```

### Code Quality Automation Script

The [`scripts/code_quality.py`](../scripts/code_quality.py) provides:
- Automated code formatting (Black + isort)
- Comprehensive linting (Ruff with 30+ rules)
- Quality score calculation (0-10 scale)
- Detailed reporting with recommendations
- CI/CD integration support

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
jobs:
  code-quality:
    - Black formatting check (line-length 119)
    - isort import sorting check
