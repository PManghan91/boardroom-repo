# Task 10: Redis Streams and Worker Integration (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement essential Redis Streams for async processing and basic worker communication, focusing on core functionality for solo development needs.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Basic Redis Streams implementation
- [ ] Simple task queue management
- [ ] Essential worker process setup
- [ ] Basic retry mechanisms for external calls
- [ ] Simple circuit breaker implementation
- [ ] Redis connection pooling basics
- [ ] Basic worker health checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Redis Streams handle essential worker communication
- Task queues process core jobs reliably
- Basic worker scaling functional
- Essential retry mechanisms operational
- Simple circuit breakers prevent basic failures
- Redis performance adequate for MVP

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Timeline**: Week 7-8 (Days 4-7)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential async processing

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 09 (LangGraph integration), Task 02 (database schema)
- **Blocks**: Task 15 (deployment - requires worker infrastructure)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 07 (monitoring)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use Redis Streams for essential message delivery
- Basic error handling and simple dead letter queues
- Support for basic worker scaling
- Maintain compatibility with existing FastAPI application
- Simple Redis configuration

## Success Metrics
- Essential message delivery functional
- Workers handle core job processing
- Basic circuit breakers reduce common failures
- Redis setup documented and maintainable
- Worker processes reliable for MVP needs

## Notes
Essential for async processing in solo development. Focus on core functionality that enables basic worker patterns and async task processing.
