- Component-level health validation: API, database, authentication, rate limiter, monitoring
- Database connectivity validation through `database_service.health_check()`
- Health status aggregation with degraded/healthy status reporting
- Timestamp and environment information in health responses
- Rate-limited health checks for protection against abuse

**3. Practical Logging Configuration (`app/core/logging.py`)**
- Structured logging with `structlog` for consistency and searchability
- Environment-specific formatters: console-friendly development, JSON production
- Daily log file rotation with JSONL format for easy parsing
- Comprehensive log processors with timestamps, stack traces, and callsite info
- File and console handlers with configurable log levels
- Environment context inclusion in all log entries
- Sanitized logging to prevent sensitive data exposure

**4. Basic Alerting Setup (`app/core/error_monitoring.py`)**
- Real-time error monitoring system with `ErrorMonitor` class
- Configurable alert thresholds (default: 10 errors per 60-minute window)
- Error aggregation and pattern detection across request paths
- Alert rate limiting to prevent notification spam (10-minute cooldown)
- Error categorization by type, status code, and affected paths
- Console alerts for solo development with structured error summaries
- Error metrics tracking: count, first/last occurrence, affected paths

**5. Core Performance Monitoring (`app/core/middleware.py`)**
- `MetricsMiddleware` for automatic HTTP request duration tracking
- Request/response time measurement and Prometheus metric export
- Performance baseline establishment for regression detection
- Memory usage and resource consumption monitoring capabilities
- Concurrent request handling performance validation
- Response time validation with configurable thresholds

**6. Enhanced Security and Validation Monitoring**
- `ValidationMiddleware` with suspicious pattern detection
- Real-time security event logging and alerting
- Request size limits and header validation monitoring
- XSS/SQL injection pattern detection with alerting
- Path traversal and command injection monitoring
- Client IP tracking for security analysis

**7. Error Monitoring API Endpoints (`app/main.py`)**
- `/monitoring/errors` - Error summary and monitoring health status
- Error aggregation for last 24 hours with detailed metrics
- Error type categorization with occurrence statistics
- JSON-formatted error reports for external monitoring integration
- Rate-limited access to prevent monitoring system abuse

**8. Comprehensive Exception Handling Integration**
- Integration with existing `BoardroomException` hierarchy from Task 05
- Automatic error recording for all exception types
- Sanitized error responses without sensitive data exposure
- Consistent error format across all monitoring touchpoints
- Exception-to-metric mapping for comprehensive coverage
