# Task 07: Essential Monitoring and Observability (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Set up essential monitoring and observability for solo maintenance, focusing on practical troubleshooting tools and basic system health monitoring.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Basic Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Essential service health checks
- [ ] Practical logging configuration
- [ ] Simple Grafana dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Basic alerting setup
- [ ] Core performance monitoring
- [ ] Monitoring setup documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Essential metrics collected and exported to Prometheus
- Health checks validate core service dependencies
- Logging sufficient for troubleshooting common issues
- Basic Grafana dashboards display key system metrics
- Alerts configured for critical system issues
- Core performance bottlenecks identifiable

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 7-8 (Days 1-3)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential monitoring for solo operations

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 05 (error handling/logging), Task 06 (testing)
- **Blocks**: Task 15 (deployment requires monitoring)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 13 (service integration)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use existing Prometheus and Grafana setup in docker-compose
- Implement basic metrics for core functionality monitoring
- Simple log aggregation setup
- Basic alerting for critical issues
- Minimal monitoring overhead

## Success Metrics
- Core services reporting health status
- Essential business metrics tracked
- Basic alerting functional
- Monitoring setup documented for solo maintenance
- Monitoring supports troubleshooting

## Notes
Essential for solo maintenance and troubleshooting. Focus on practical monitoring that aids in problem identification and system health assessment.
