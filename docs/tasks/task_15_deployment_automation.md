# Task 15: Simple Deployment Infrastructure (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Set up practical deployment infrastructure for solo operations, focusing on simple, reliable deployment with basic monitoring and easy rollback capabilities.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Optimized Dockerfile for production use
- [ ] Simple environment management with secrets
- [ ] Basic deployment pipeline with testing
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for simple orchestration
- [ ] Basic deployment rollback procedures
- [ ] Essential infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] Simple deployment documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docker builds optimized for production use
- Secrets managed securely for solo deployment
- Deployment pipeline includes essential testing
- Simple rollback procedures functional
- Basic infrastructure monitoring operational
- Deployment process documented for solo use

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Timeline**: Week 9 (Days 1-4)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Simple, reliable deployment focused on solo operations

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Core tasks (especially 07, 13, 14)
- **Blocks**: None (final implementation task)
- **Parallel**: Can coordinate with Task 16 (documentation)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use Docker with simple multi-stage builds
- Simple deployment strategy (rolling restart acceptable)
- Basic horizontal scaling support
- Integration with basic monitoring setup
- Focus on reliability over complexity

## Success Metrics
- Docker builds efficient and secure
- Deployment process reliable for solo operations
- Basic rollback procedures functional
- Essential infrastructure monitoring working
- Deployment documented for future reference

## Notes
Final implementation task focused on practical deployment for solo operations. Emphasize reliability and maintainability over advanced deployment strategies.
