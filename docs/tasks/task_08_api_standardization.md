# Task 08: API Standardization and Documentation (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement essential API consistency patterns and leverage FastAPI's auto-generated documentation, focusing on practical standards for solo development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Consistent API response format for core endpoints
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation (auto-generated)
- [ ] Basic API versioning approach
- [ ] Essential request/response validation
- [ ] API documentation with basic examples
- [ ] Core endpoint testing and validation
- [ ] Basic API usage patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core endpoints return standardized response format
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generated with examples
- Basic versioning approach documented
- Essential requests/responses validated
- Documentation includes common scenarios
- API follows basic RESTful principles

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 5-6 (Days 1-3)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential API consistency and auto-generated documentation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Tasks 02 (database), 03 (auth), 04 (validation), 05 (errors)
- **Blocks**: Tasks 09, 10 (business logic implementation)
- **Parallel**: Can coordinate with documentation tasks

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI generation
- Implement consistent HTTP status code usage
- Basic API pagination where needed
- Focus on essential API patterns
- Auto-generated documentation with examples

## Success Metrics
- Core endpoint documentation coverage via OpenAPI
- Consistent response format across endpoints
- API documentation supports development workflow
- Minimal breaking changes
- API patterns documented for consistency

## Notes
Foundation for consistent API development. Focus on auto-generated documentation and essential patterns that support solo development workflow.
