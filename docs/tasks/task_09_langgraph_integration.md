# Task 09: LangGraph Integration Completion (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Complete core LangGraph boardroom functionality with focus on essential multi-agent workflows, emphasizing practical implementation and maintainable patterns for solo development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Core LangGraph boardroom implementation
- [ ] Essential service abstractions for business logic
- [ ] Basic business rule validation
- [ ] Simplified multi-agent workflow management
- [ ] Basic state management and synchronization
- [ ] Essential LangGraph performance optimization
- [ ] Integration testing with API layer

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core boardroom functionality operational
- Business logic properly separated from API layer
- Essential business rules enforced
- Basic multi-agent interactions functional
- State management prevents core race conditions
- Performance adequate for MVP requirements

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Timeline**: Week 6-7 (Days 1-5)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential boardroom workflows

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 08 (API standardization), Task 02 (database schema)
- **Blocks**: Task 10 (Redis integration), Task 11 (performance optimization)
- **Parallel**: Can coordinate with Task 13 (service integration)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Build on existing LangGraph architecture
- Implement basic error handling for AI model failures
- Support essential concurrent agent interactions
- Focus on core functionality over complex optimization
- Integration with existing database models

## Success Metrics
- Core boardroom scenarios function correctly
- Basic multi-agent coordination successful
- Essential business rules prevent invalid states
- Performance supports basic concurrent usage
- Integration tests pass reliably

## Notes
Core product functionality for MVP. Focus on essential boardroom workflows that demonstrate value. Establish patterns that can be extended for future scaling.
