# Task 01: Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Conduct security analysis using automated tools and Claude Code review to identify critical vulnerabilities and establish secure coding practices for solo development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Automated security scan results (bandit, safety)
- [ ] Code review for authentication patterns
- [ ] Input validation security analysis
- [ ] Configuration security checklist
- [ ] CORS configuration review
- [ ] Secret management audit
- [ ] Prioritized fix list for critical issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- Critical vulnerabilities identified and documented
- Authentication security patterns established
- Input validation gaps identified in core endpoints
- Configuration security baseline established
- Security practices documented for ongoing development
- Automated security checks integrated into workflow

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 1 (Days 1-3)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Automated tools + systematic code review

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: None (foundation task)
- **Blocks**: Tasks 02, 03, 04 (security findings guide implementation)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 05 (error handling setup)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use automated security scanning tools (bandit, safety, semgrep)
- Focus on critical security patterns in existing code
- Review configuration files and environment setup
- Prioritize fixes based on ease of implementation
- Document security practices for ongoing development

## Success Metrics
- Zero critical vulnerabilities in core functionality
- Security scanning integrated into development workflow
- Essential security practices documented
- Authentication and authorization patterns secure
- Configuration security baseline established

## Notes
Foundation task for secure development. Focus on practical security measures that can be maintained during solo development. Establish patterns that scale with future team growth.
