# Task 03: Authentication and Authorization Implementation (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement practical JWT authentication with essential role-based access control, focusing on security fundamentals and maintainable patterns for solo development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] JWT implementation with proper validation
- [ ] Basic role-based access control (admin/user roles)
- [ ] Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] Simple session management and token refresh
- [ ] Authentication middleware integration
- [ ] Basic authorization decorators
- [ ] Authentication setup documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- JWT tokens properly signed and validated
- Basic RBAC system enforces access controls
- Password hashing follows security standards
- Token refresh mechanism functional
- Authentication errors handled gracefully
- Core endpoints properly protected

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Timeline**: Week 3 (Days 1-4)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential security with practical implementation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 01 (security audit), Task 02 (database schema)
- **Blocks**: Tasks 08, 09, 10 (API endpoints need authentication)
- **Parallel**: Can overlap with Task 04 (input validation)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use python-jose or PyJWT for JWT handling
- Implement essential token expiration and refresh
- Support basic user roles (admin, user)
- Integrate with FastAPI's built-in security features
- Keep authentication patterns simple and maintainable

## Success Metrics
- Zero critical authentication vulnerabilities
- Core protected endpoints require valid authentication
- Basic RBAC system functional
- Token refresh mechanism works reliably
- Authentication performance adequate for MVP

## Notes
Focus on security fundamentals without over-engineering. Establish patterns that can be extended as the project grows. Document authentication flow for future reference and team onboarding.
