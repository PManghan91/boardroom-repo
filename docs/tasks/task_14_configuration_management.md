# Task 14: Configuration Management and Security (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement essential configuration management and basic secret handling for solo development, focusing on practical security and maintainable configuration patterns.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] All secrets moved to environment variables
- [ ] Basic secret management for solo deployment
- [ ] Configuration validation on application startup
- [ ] Environment-specific CORS configuration
- [ ] Configuration documentation and examples
- [ ] Simple secret management procedures
- [ ] Basic configuration testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Basic secret management functional and documented
- Application fails fast on invalid configuration
- CORS configuration appropriate for deployment environment
- Configuration patterns documented for consistency
- Simple secret management process established

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Timeline**: Week 3 (Days 5-6)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential configuration security

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 01 (security audit), Task 03 (authentication)
- **Blocks**: Task 15 (deployment requires secure configuration)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 04 (input validation)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use environment variables and simple secret management
- Implement basic configuration validation with clear error messages
- Support for essential environments (dev, production)
- Simple configuration migration approach
- Basic security for secrets handling

## Success Metrics
- Zero secrets exposed in source code or logs
- Configuration validation catches critical invalid configs
- Secret management process documented and functional
- Environment configurations properly separated
- Configuration approach supports solo development workflow

## Notes
Focus on practical configuration security that supports solo development while establishing patterns that can scale. Document configuration approaches for consistency.
