# Task 16: Essential Documentation and Knowledge Capture (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Create essential documentation for solo maintenance and future scaling, focusing on practical guides and knowledge capture for sustainable development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] API documentation (auto-generated from FastAPI)
- [ ] Basic system architecture documentation
- [ ] Simple deployment procedures
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Development setup and patterns documentation
- [ ] Future team onboarding guide
- [ ] Solo development workflow documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core API endpoints documented via OpenAPI
- Architecture overview enables understanding of system design
- Deployment procedures enable consistent deployments
- Troubleshooting guide covers common solo development issues
- Development patterns documented for consistency
- Future scaling documentation prepared

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 9-10 (Days 1-3)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential, maintainable documentation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All previous tasks (documents final implementations)
- **Blocks**: None (final documentation task)
- **Parallel**: Can coordinate with Task 15 (deployment)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use simple, maintainable documentation format
- Focus on practical, actionable information
- Ensure documentation supports solo workflow
- Prepare for future team scaling
- Keep documentation version-controlled and current

## Success Metrics
- Core functionality documented for maintenance
- Architecture clear enough for future development
- Deployment procedures reliable for solo use
- Troubleshooting guide reduces debugging time
- Documentation enables future team onboarding

## Notes
Essential knowledge capture for sustainable solo development and future scaling. Focus on practical documentation that supports ongoing maintenance and reduces dependency on memory.
