# Task 12: Code Quality and Structure Improvements (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Establish essential code quality standards and improve code structure for maintainable solo development, focusing on practical quality measures.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions for core modules
- [ ] Essential type hints for public APIs
- [ ] Refactor large functions in `app/core/langgraph/graph.py`
- [ ] Resolve critical circular dependencies
- [ ] Basic code quality tooling setup (ruff, black)
- [ ] Simple pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Solo development quality guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core code follows consistent naming conventions
- Type hints cover essential public APIs
- Large functions broken into manageable units
- Critical circular dependencies resolved
- Basic code quality checks integrated
- Quality guidelines documented

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 1-2 (Days 5-7)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential quality improvements

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 06 (testing suite for refactoring safety)
- **Blocks**: None (improves all subsequent development)
- **Parallel**: Can run with other foundation tasks

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use automated code formatting tools (black, ruff)
- Basic type checking setup
- Maintain functionality during refactoring
- Focus on high-impact quality improvements
- Simple, maintainable quality standards

## Success Metrics
- Core code follows quality standards
- Critical circular dependencies resolved
- Type checking covers essential APIs
- Quality tooling integrated into workflow
- Code maintainability improved

## Notes
Focus on essential quality improvements that provide maximum benefit for solo development. Establish patterns that support long-term maintainability.
