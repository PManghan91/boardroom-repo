# Task 06: Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Set up practical testing suite focused on core functionality, emphasizing essential test coverage and maintainable testing patterns for solo development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Pytest configuration with basic test discovery
- [ ] Unit tests for core business logic in `app/services/`
- [ ] Integration tests for key API endpoints
- [ ] Essential test fixtures and mock data
- [ ] Code coverage reporting setup (target: 70%+)
- [ ] Basic performance testing for critical paths
- [ ] Testing approach documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core business logic covered by unit tests
- Key API endpoints covered by integration tests
- Test coverage meets 70%+ target for core modules
- Tests pass consistently
- Mock data covers essential scenarios
- Basic performance validation for key endpoints

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3 (Days 5-8)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on high-value testing with practical coverage

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 05 (error handling for proper test assertions)
- **Blocks**: None (validates all other tasks)
- **Parallel**: Can run parallel with database and authentication tasks

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use pytest with essential plugins (pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov)
- Implement basic test isolation and cleanup
- Create realistic test data for core scenarios
- Focus on testing critical business logic paths
- Simple test execution workflow

## Success Metrics
- Code coverage â‰¥70% across core modules
- Tests execute in reasonable time (<10 minutes)
- Minimal flaky tests
- Testing patterns documented for consistency
- Core functionality validated

## Notes
Focus on high-value testing that catches critical bugs and supports confident refactoring. Establish testing patterns that can scale with project growth.
