# Task 02: Database Schema Alignment and Migration System (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Align database schema with model definitions and establish practical migration system for solo development workflow, focusing on data integrity and maintainability.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Schema alignment between `schema.sql` and model definitions
- [ ] Essential foreign key constraints
- [ ] Basic Alembic migration setup
- [ ] Core database validation constraints
- [ ] Simple migration procedures
- [ ] Data integrity checks
- [ ] Basic database documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Database schema matches core model definitions
- Key foreign key relationships properly enforced
- Alembic migration system functional for solo workflow
- Essential database constraints prevent invalid data
- Migration procedures documented for solo use
- Core data integrity validated

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3 (Days 4-6)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential relationships and constraints

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 01 (security audit findings)
- **Blocks**: Tasks 08, 09, 10 (API implementation depends on schema)
- **Parallel**: Can coordinate with Task 06 (testing setup)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use PostgreSQL with essential constraints and indexing
- Maintain data integrity during migrations
- Implement core validation at database level
- Support basic connection pooling
- Keep migration scripts simple and clear

## Success Metrics
- Core schema-model alignment verified
- Essential foreign key relationships functional
- Migration system supports solo development workflow
- Zero critical data integrity violations
- Database setup documented for future reference

## Notes
Focus on essential data integrity and maintainable migration approach. Avoid over-engineering while ensuring core relationships are solid. Document patterns for future scaling.
