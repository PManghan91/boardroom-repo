# Task 02: Database Schema Alignment and Migration System

## Overview
✅ **COMPLETED** - Established comprehensive database schema alignment and migration system to ensure consistency between SQL schema and SQLModel definitions.

## Context
Building on Task 01's security foundation, this task addressed:
- Schema mismatch between [`schema.sql`](../../schema.sql) and model definitions
- Missing foreign key relationships and constraints
- Absence of migration system
- Data integrity concerns

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Schema Analysis and Alignment ✅
- [x] **Analyzed Current Schema**: Compared [`schema.sql`](../../schema.sql) with model definitions
- [x] **Identified Discrepancies**: Found missing foreign keys, constraints, and relationship enforcement
- [x] **Created Aligned Schema**: Developed [`schema_new.sql`](../../schema_new.sql) with proper relationships
- [x] **Model Analysis**: Reviewed all models - [`User`](../../app/models/user.py), [`Boardroom`](../../app/models/boardroom.py), [`Session`](../../app/models/session.py), [`Thread`](../../app/models/thread.py)

### 2. Database Migration System Setup ✅
- [x] **Alembic Installation**: Added Alembic to [`pyproject.toml`](../../pyproject.toml) dependencies
- [x] **Alembic Configuration**: Set up [`alembic.ini`](../../alembic.ini) and [`alembic/env.py`](../../alembic/env.py)
- [x] **Model Integration**: Connected SQLModel metadata to Alembic for autogeneration
- [x] **Migration Scripts**: Created [`scripts/db_migrate.sh`](../../scripts/db_migrate.sh) for migration management
- [x] **Solo Development Workflow**: Established simple migration commands and procedures

### 3. Foreign Key Relationships ✅
- [x] **Core Relationships Implemented**:
  - `boardrooms.owner_id` → `users.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
  - `sessions.boardroom_id` → `boardrooms.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
  - `sessions.user_id` → `users.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
  - `threads.session_id` → `sessions.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
  - `threads.user_id` → `users.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
- [x] **Cascading Rules**: Proper CASCADE DELETE for data consistency
- [x] **Referential Integrity**: All relationships properly enforced at database level

### 4. Database Constraints and Validation ✅
- [x] **Email Validation**: Regex constraint for valid email format in users table
- [x] **Status Constraints**: CHECK constraints for valid status values (sessions, threads)
- [x] **Business Logic Constraints**: Max participants, priority ranges, date validations
- [x] **NOT NULL Constraints**: Essential fields properly enforced
- [x] **Unique Constraints**: Email uniqueness and other business requirements

### 5. Enhanced Connection and Configuration ✅
- [x] **Enhanced Database Service**: Updated [`app/services/database.py`](../../app/services/database.py) with:
  - Async support with SQLAlchemy 2.x
  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Enhanced connection pooling configuration
  - Detailed health check functionality
  - Improved error handling for operational errors
- [x] **Configuration Updates**: Enhanced [`app/core/config.py`](../../app/core/config.py) with async database URLs
- [x] **Connection Testing**: Built-in connection verification and pool status monitoring

### 6. Migration Tools and Documentation ✅
- [x] **Migration Scripts**:
  - [`scripts/migrate_schema.py`](../../scripts/migrate_schema.py) - Automated schema migration
  - [`scripts/db_migrate.sh`](../../scripts/db_migrate.sh) - Migration management CLI
- [x] **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete setup and usage procedures
- [x] **Migration Procedures**: Step-by-step migration and rollback instructions

## Database Schema Structure

### Tables and Relationships
```
users (id, email, hashed_password, full_name, is_active, is_verified, created_at, updated_at)
├── boardrooms (owner_id → users.id)
    ├── sessions (boardroom_id → boardrooms.id, user_id → users.id)
        └── threads (session_id → sessions.id, user_id → users.id)
```

### Key Features
- **UUID Primary Keys**: All tables use UUID for scalability and security
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` with database triggers
- **Comprehensive Indexing**: Performance indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Data Validation**: Database-level constraints for business rules
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships with cascading

## Model Enhancements

### User Model Updates
- **UUID Primary Key**: Changed from integer to UUID for better scalability
- **Additional Fields**: Added `full_name`, `is_active`, `is_verified`, `updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Added `owned_boardrooms` relationship
- **Constraints**: Email validation, name length checks

### New Boardroom Model
- **Complete Rewrite**: Converted from SQLAlchemy Base to SQLModel
- **Proper Relationships**: Owner and sessions relationships
- **Business Constraints**: Max participants, name validation
- **Status Management**: Active/inactive states

### Session Model Enhancements
- **Dual Relationships**: Both boardroom and user foreign keys
- **Enhanced Fields**: Title, description, status, timing
- **Status Management**: Active, completed, paused, cancelled states
- **Thread Relationship**: One-to-many with threads

### Thread Model Updates
- **Rich Categorization**: Type field for discussion, decision, action_item, note
- **Priority System**: 1-5 priority levels
- **Status Management**: Active, closed, archived states
- **Proper Relationships**: Session and user foreign keys

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Database Migration Commands
```bash
# Check migration status
./scripts/db_migrate.sh check

# Generate new migration
./scripts/db_migrate.sh generate "description of changes"

# Apply migrations
./scripts/db_migrate.sh upgrade

# Apply manual schema migration
./scripts/db_migrate.sh schema

# Generate offline SQL migration
./scripts/db_migrate.sh offline

# View migration history
./scripts/db_migrate.sh history
```

### 2. Database Health Check
```python
from app.services.database import DatabaseService

db_service = DatabaseService()
health_info = await db_service.health_check()
print(health_info)
```

### 3. Schema Migration Process
1. **Backup existing data** (handled automatically)
2. **Apply schema updates** (add columns, constraints)
3. **Add foreign key relationships**
4. **Create performance indexes**
5. **Verify migration success**
