# Task 04: Input Validation and Sanitization (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement essential input validation using Pydantic schemas and basic rate limiting, focusing on core security and practical implementation for solo development.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Pydantic schema validation for core endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection through ORM best practices
- [ ] Basic input sanitization for user data
- [ ] Simple rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Standardized validation error responses
- [ ] Basic validation middleware
- [ ] Validation pattern documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core API endpoints validate input using Pydantic schemas
- SQL injection prevented through proper ORM usage
- User inputs sanitized for essential cases
- Basic rate limiting active on public endpoints
- Validation errors return consistent responses
- Common attack vectors blocked

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 3 (Days 2-4)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on essential validation patterns

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 01 (security audit), Task 02 (database schema)
- **Blocks**: None (enhances security of other tasks)
- **Parallel**: Can run parallel with Task 03 (authentication)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use FastAPI's built-in Pydantic integration
- Implement essential validators for business rules
- Basic rate limiting using FastAPI-limiter
- Ensure validation doesn't significantly impact performance
- Focus on common use cases

## Success Metrics
- Core endpoints have input validation
- Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities in testing
- Basic rate limiting prevents simple abuse
- Validation overhead minimal
- Common edge cases handled

## Notes
Focus on essential security patterns that provide maximum protection with minimal complexity. Document validation approaches for consistency across development.
