# Task 11: Performance Optimization and Caching (Solo Execution)

## Task Description
Implement essential performance optimizations and basic caching strategy, focusing on practical improvements for solo development workflow.

## Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Database query optimization with essential indexing
- [ ] Basic caching strategy implementation
- [ ] Simple connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Async/await consistency for core operations
- [ ] Basic performance profiling
- [ ] Simple load testing for critical paths
- [ ] Performance monitoring basics

## Acceptance Criteria
- Core database queries perform adequately
- Basic caching improves response times for common operations
- Connection pooling configured appropriately
- Essential I/O operations use proper async patterns
- Major performance bottlenecks identified
- System handles expected MVP load

## Estimated Effort/Timeline
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Timeline**: Week 5-6 (Days 4-6)
- **Resources**: Founder + Claude Code
- **Approach**: Focus on high-impact optimizations

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Task 02 (database schema), Task 09 (LangGraph)
- **Blocks**: Task 15 (deployment requires performance validation)
- **Parallel**: Can run with Task 10 (Redis integration)

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
- Use Redis for basic application-level caching
- Implement essential database query optimization
- Maintain data consistency during optimization
- Simple cache invalidation strategies
- Ensure optimizations don't break functionality

## Success Metrics
- API response times adequate for MVP (< 1000ms)
- Database queries perform reasonably
- Basic cache hit ratio for common operations
- Connection pool setup appropriate for load
- System handles expected user load

## Notes
Focus on practical performance improvements that provide the most benefit for development effort. Establish baseline metrics and validate improvements.
