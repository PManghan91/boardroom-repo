# Development Workflow

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Author**: Founder  
**Audience**: Solo Developer (Self)  
**Next Review**: As needed  

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for solo development on Boardroom AI. It's designed for efficiency while maintaining quality and the ability to scale when needed.

## Development Cycle

### Daily Workflow

**Morning (30 mins)**
1. Review overnight monitoring alerts
2. Check error logs from production
3. Review and prioritize tasks
4. Update todo list

**Development Blocks (2-4 hours)**
1. Focus on single feature/fix
2. Write tests alongside code
3. Commit frequently with clear messages
4. Deploy to staging for testing

**End of Day (30 mins)**
1. Deploy tested changes to production
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Note any issues for tomorrow
4. Backup critical work

### Weekly Rhythm

**Monday**: Planning & Architecture
- Review previous week's progress
- Plan week's priorities
- Address technical debt
- Update dependencies

**Tuesday-Thursday**: Feature Development
- Core development work
- New features and improvements
- Bug fixes from user feedback

**Friday**: Operations & Maintenance
- Security updates
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates
- Backup verification

## Task Management

### Simple Tracking System

Using `TODO.md` in project root:

```markdown
# TODO

## In Progress
- [ ] Add rate limiting to chat endpoint
  - Started: 2025-01-07
  - Branch: feature/rate-limiting

## High Priority
- [ ] Fix memory leak in LangGraph agent
- [ ] Implement session cleanup job
- [ ] Add password reset flow

## Backlog
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Export conversation feature
- [ ] Team collaboration

## Completed This Week
- [x] Database connection pooling
- [x] Redis cache integration
```

### Branch Strategy

Keep it simple:
```
main (production)
  ├── feature/feature-name
  ├── fix/bug-description
  └── hotfix/urgent-fix
```

**Workflow:**
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Develop and test locally
3. Deploy to staging from branch
4. Merge to main when stable
5. Deploy to production

## Testing Strategy

### Before Every Deploy

1. **Quick Smoke Test** (5 mins)
   ```bash
   # Run core tests
   pytest tests/unit/test_auth.py tests/unit/test_chat.py
   
   # Check API health
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Manual Testing** (10 mins)
   - Login flow
   - Send chat message
   - Check response quality
   - Verify error handling

3. **Performance Check** (5 mins)
   ```bash
   # Quick load test
   hey -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
   ```

### Weekly Deep Testing

Every Friday:
1. Run full test suite
2. Check all integrations
3. Review error logs
4. Test backup restoration

## Deployment Process

### Quick Deploy (< 5 mins)

For small changes:
```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: improve chat response time"

# 2. Push to main
git push origin main

# 3. Deploy
ssh production
cd /app/boardroom
git pull
docker-compose up -d --build app

# 4. Verify
curl https://boardroom.ai/health
```

### Full Deploy (< 30 mins)

For significant changes:
1. Create feature branch
2. Test locally thoroughly
3. Deploy to staging
4. Test in staging environment
5. Merge to main
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor for 30 minutes

### Rollback Plan

Always be ready to rollback:
```bash
# Quick rollback
git checkout HEAD~1
docker-compose up -d --build

# Or using tags
git checkout v1.0.0
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Issue Tracking

### Lightweight System

Using GitHub Issues with labels:
- `bug`: Something broken
- `feature`: New functionality
- `urgent`: Needs immediate attention
- `tech-debt`: Code improvements
- `docs`: Documentation updates

### Issue Template

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of issue

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Go to...
2. Click on...
3. See error...

## Expected Behavior
What should happen

## Actual Behavior
What actually happens

## Priority
High/Medium/Low

## Notes
Any additional context
```

## Code Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] No console.logs or debug code
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Basic tests written
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] API changes documented
- [ ] Performance impact considered

### AI-Assisted Review

Use Claude Code for code review:
```
"Review this code for security issues, performance problems, and best practices"
```

## Documentation Updates

### When to Update Docs

- New API endpoint added
- Breaking change made
- New dependency added
- Deployment process changed
- Common error discovered

### Quick Doc Updates

Keep a `CHANGELOG.md`:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Chat streaming support
- Redis caching layer

### Fixed
- Memory leak in LangGraph agent
- Rate limiting not applying correctly

### Changed
- Increased default timeout to 30s
```

## Monitoring Routine

### Daily Checks (5 mins)

```bash
# Morning routine script
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Daily Health Check ==="
curl https://boardroom.ai/health
echo "\n=== Error Count ==="
grep ERROR logs/production-*.jsonl | wc -l
echo "\n=== Response Times ==="
grep response_time logs/production-*.jsonl | tail -10
```

### Weekly Analysis

Every Friday:
1. Review Grafana dashboards
2. Check slow query logs
3. Analyze error patterns
4. Plan optimizations

## Emergency Procedures

### When Things Break

1. **Don't Panic** - You have backups
2. **Check Logs** - Find the actual error
3. **Quick Fix** - If obvious, fix it
4. **Rollback** - If not, rollback immediately
5. **Investigate** - Debug with system stable
6. **Document** - Add to troubleshooting guide

### Emergency Contacts

Keep these handy:
- Server provider support
- Domain registrar
- Payment processor
- Critical service APIs

## Productivity Tips

### Time Management

- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25 min focused work, 5 min break
- **Time Blocking**: Dedicate blocks to specific tasks
- **No Meeting Zones**: Core development hours

### Automation

Automate repetitive tasks:
```bash
# Deployment alias
alias deploy='git push && ssh prod "cd /app && git pull && docker-compose up -d"'

# Log checking
alias logs='ssh prod "tail -f /app/logs/production-*.jsonl | grep ERROR"'

# Quick backup
alias backup='ssh prod "/app/scripts/backup.sh"'
```

### Mental Health

- Take regular breaks
- Don't deploy on Friday evening
- Keep a "wins" log for motivation
- Set realistic deadlines
- Ask for help when needed

## Scaling Preparation

### When to Consider Help

- Consistently working > 50 hours/week
- Feature backlog > 3 months
- Can't take vacation without worry
- Security becomes concerning
- Customer support overwhelming

### Preparing for Team

- Document as you go
- Keep code clean
- Maintain test coverage
- Use standard patterns
- Create onboarding guide

## Tools and Resources

### Essential Tools

- **IDE**: VS Code with extensions
- **API Testing**: Insomnia/Postman
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards
- **Communication**: User feedback channel
- **Version Control**: Git with clear commits
