# Archive Log - Project Scope Reduction

## Overview
This document tracks files and documentation that have been archived due to the project scope change from a multi-team effort to a **solo founder + Claude Code** approach.

**Scope Change Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Reason**: Project pivot to lean, MVP-focused development with solo execution

## Archived Documents

### Root Level Files Removed (January 7, 2025)
*The following root-level files from the previous multi-team approach have been removed during workspace cleanup:*

- **ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md** - Team-focused engineering review document
- **Project_Roadmap.md** - Multi-team timeline and resource allocation plan
- **Technical_Analysis.md** - Complex architecture analysis for team coordination
- **project_context.md** - Original project context assuming team collaboration

**Status**: Files deleted from root directory during scope reduction
**Action Taken**: Physical files removed from workspace (not moved to archive folder)
**Reason**: These documents were designed for multi-team coordination and are no longer relevant for solo development approach

### Team Collaboration Documents
*Documents that assumed multiple team members and complex collaboration workflows have been simplified or archived.*

## Scope Reductions Applied

### 1. Resource Requirements
- **Before**: Multiple specialists (Security Engineers, ML Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Database Engineers, QA Engineers, Technical Writers)
- **After**: Founder + Claude Code only

### 2. Timeline Adjustments
- **Before**: 7-week timeline with parallel team execution
- **After**: Extended timeline accounting for solo execution and learning curve

### 3. Complexity Reductions
- **Before**: Enterprise-scale architecture and over-engineering
- **After**: Lean, MVP-focused implementation with practical solutions

### 4. Documentation Requirements
- **Before**: Comprehensive team collaboration documentation
- **After**: Essential documentation for solo development and future maintenance

## Maintained Scope

### Core Functionality Preserved
- All 16 core tasks remain relevant for solo execution
- Security and quality standards maintained
- Technical architecture simplified but not compromised
- MVP functionality fully achievable

### Documentation Focus
- Essential technical documentation
- Simplified maintenance processes
- Self-service troubleshooting guides
- Future team onboarding preparation
